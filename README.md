## The Application Scenario

We would like a simple application to order a pizza.

* The default page would allow the user to select between Pick Up or Delivery
* Once selected, the app should load the 5 types of pizza we offer (Picture not required)
  * Chonky Chicken 10$
  * Beef Barbeque 12$
  * Hawking Hawaiian 10$
  * Margeret's Margherita 8$
  * Vegan Villa Vista 8$
* Selecting a pizza should give the user a few options:
  * Select the size (Small, Medium, Large)
  * Select if they would like extra cheese (Yes or No)
  * Select the quantity
* The user is allowed to select multiple pizzas
* The user is also allowed to remove pizzas
* Once the order is complete they can proceed to checkout
* The checkout should display a summary of their order including the pizzas'
  * Sizes
  * Cheese
  * Quantity
  * Total price
  * And method of delivery
* Have a button to confirm the user order which will thank the user before redirecting them to the main page
* And another button that cancels the order and goes straight back to the main page
* If the user navigates to unknown pages (Such as writing on the URL), redirect them to a generic "Page not found"
